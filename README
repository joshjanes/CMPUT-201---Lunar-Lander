IMPROVMENTS/ BUG FIXES:
-Draws a more detailed ship similar to the one found in the original 1979 
 Lunar Lander.
-Ship is drawn in color.
-Instead of getting stuck at the edge of the screen when you fly into the edge,
 the program prints a message notifying the user that the lander was lost.
-Ship breaks into pieces when crash occurs.
